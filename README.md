# **About this repository**
This repository contains code sample using restAssured with Cucumber and Maven  to achieve BDD concepts while testing APIS 

  # **Environment :-** 


    # JAVA ===> java 17
    # RestAcssured ===> dealing with web apis 
    # TestNG ===>  test runner and annotations provider 
    # Maven ===> build and mangement tool with its pom.xml file 
    # Cucumber ===> to achieve BDD
    # IntelliJ ===> IDE
    # pojo class ===> serialization and deserialization
  
  
  
  # **Runner** :- 
  
     # CMD ====>  mvn clean test   from the level of project Ex (cd Downloads/ ApisFoodics)
     # or we can run TestRunner class    <cucumberOption.TestRunner>
     # we will find cucumber HTML Reporort created inside target/Reports/cucumber/html.html

  # **Target** :- 
  
     # Create a cucumber BDD solution utilising RestAssured framework to accomplish the following. â€œMake a GET request to colourlovers api http://www.colourlovers.com/api/patterns and write an assertion for <numViews> (from response) to be greater than 4000
     
     
   # **Note** :- 
     
     # in case of java version != 17 we can change the default SDK for projetcs modules to the current installed java version as following : 
          1- Open File menu 
          2- Open Project Structure 
          3- Choose from the dropdown menu the available java version 
          4- Click Apply then OK 
          After that you might need to restart the IDE
